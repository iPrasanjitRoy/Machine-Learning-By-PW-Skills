    "## Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous numeric value (output) based on one or more input features. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the inputs and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is also a supervised machine learning algorithm, but it's used for classification tasks. Instead of predicting numeric values, it predicts the probability of an input belonging to a particular class. The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference and Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference lies in the type of prediction. Linear regression predicts a continuous numeric value, while logistic regression predicts the probability of belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example where logistic regression would be more appropriate. Imagine you're building a spam email classifier. The task is to predict whether an incoming email is spam (1) or not spam (0) based on the email's content features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, you're dealing with a binary classification problem (spam or not spam). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a suitable choice because it provides probability scores indicating the likelihood of an email being spam. The algorithm learns to distinguish between the two classes based on the input features and assigns a probability of an email being spam. This probability can then be used to classify emails as spam or not based on a threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both linear regression and logistic regression are regression algorithms, logistic regression is specifically designed for classification tasks involving binary or multi-class outcomes, where the output is a probability score that can be transformed into class predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution: Adjust optimization settings like learning rate, increase the number of iterations, or try different optimization algorithms.\n",

    "# Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Identify and handle outliers, either by removing them, transforming them, or using robust regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: If the relationship between variables and the outcome isn't linear, consider adding polynomial features or using other non-linear models.\n",
