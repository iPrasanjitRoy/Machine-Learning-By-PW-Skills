    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that reduces overfitting in decision trees and other base models through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling: Bagging randomly selects subsets of the training data with replacement to create multiple bootstrap samples. This randomness reduces the risk of any single decision tree overfitting to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging or Voting: Predictions from individual decision trees are combined by averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification) to create the final prediction. This process smooths out individual tree predictions and reduces noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorrelation: Because each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample, they are somewhat decorrelated. This decorrelation helps prevent all trees from making the same errors or learning the same patterns.\n",
