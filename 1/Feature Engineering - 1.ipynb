    "The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used to select relevant features from a dataset before training a machine learning model.

    "The main differences between the filter and wrapper methods for feature selection are:\n",

    "\n",
    "Filter methods might fail to find the best subset of features in many occasions but wrapper methods can always provide the best subset of features.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: It directly involves training and evaluating a machine learning model with different subsets of features, making it computationally more expensive but potentially leading to better feature subsets.\n",
