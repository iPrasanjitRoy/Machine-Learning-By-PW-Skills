    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It involves creating algorithms and systems that enable computers to understand, reason, learn from experience, and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are a great example of AI. These are computer programs designed to simulate human conversation and provide automated responses. They use natural language processing (NLP) to understand user inputs and generate relevant responses. For instance, customer support chatbots can assist users with common queries and problems, providing instant help without human intervention.\n",

In a machine learning approach, you would feed the algorithm a dataset of emails labeled as either \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" The algorithm learns the characteristics of spam emails from the data and uses this knowledge to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. As it encounters more examples, it becomes better at identifying spam even if the characteristics change.\n",

The model would consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, each learning to recognize specific features from the data. In the case of image recognition, the model might learn to detect edges, textures, and shapes in the lower layers, and combine them to recognize more complex features like faces or animals in the deeper layers. This approach has been highly successful in tasks like image classification, where the model can accurately identify objects in images it hasn't seen during training.\n",
