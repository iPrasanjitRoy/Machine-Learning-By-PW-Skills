    "Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on certain features or characteristics. There are several different types of clustering algorithms, each with its own approach and underlying assumptions. Here are some of the most common types of clustering algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: K-Means aims to partition data into K clusters, where K is predefined by the user. It assigns each data point to the cluster whose mean (centroid) is closest to it in terms of distance, typically using Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes clusters are spherical, equally sized, and have similar densities. It works well with numeric data and assumes an equal variance among clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram, by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: It doesn't assume a fixed number of clusters and can handle various shapes and sizes of clusters. It's versatile but computationally intensive for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: DBSCAN groups data points based on their density. It forms clusters around core points and separates noise points as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: It assumes that clusters are dense regions separated by areas of lower density. DBSCAN doesn't require specifying the number of clusters in advance and can handle irregularly shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mean Shift Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Mean Shift is a density-based algorithm that iteratively shifts data points towards the mode (peak) of the local data density.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: It doesn't assume a fixed number of clusters and can adapt to cluster shapes and sizes. However, it may not perform well with data of varying densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agglomerative Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Agglomerative clustering starts with individual data points as clusters and iteratively merges the most similar clusters until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: It doesn't assume a fixed number of clusters and can produce hierarchical clustering structures. The choice of linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average) affects the results.\n",

As K increases, WCSS tends to decrease because more clusters allow for smaller distances.Look for the Elbow point in the plot where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down.

This method provides a quantitative measure of cluster quality. Silhouette analysis visualizes how well-separated the clusters are for different K values.\n",
