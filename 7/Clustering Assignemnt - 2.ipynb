    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that creates a hierarchy or tree-like structure of clusters, allowing for flexibility in exploring data structure without specifying the number of clusters in advance.

    "Approach: Hierarchical clustering starts with each data point as a single cluster and iteratively merges or divides clusters based on their similarity. It creates a tree-like structure known as a dendrogram, where the leaves represent individual data points, and internal nodes represent clusters at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "\n",

    "No Fixed K: One of the main differences is that hierarchical clustering doesn't require specifying the number of clusters (K) beforehand. You can choose the number of clusters by cutting the dendrogram at a specific height, which allows for exploring different levels of granularity.\n",
