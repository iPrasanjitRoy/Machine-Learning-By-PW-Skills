    "Choose the best feature from the dataset to split the data into subsets. \n",
    "The \"best\" feature is typically selected based on criteria like Gini impurity, information gain, or gain ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Splitting: \n",
    "Once a feature is selected, the dataset is split into subsets based on the values of that feature. Each branch of the tree represents a specific value or range of values for the selected feature.\n",

    "Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subset created in the previous step. This process is applied recursively until one of the stopping criteria is met. Stopping criteria could include a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or a purity threshold (e.g., all samples in a leaf belong to the same class).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Leaf Node Assignment: \n",
    "When a stopping criterion is met for a subset of data, a leaf node is created, and it is assigned the most common class label (in the case of classification) or the mean/median value (in the case of regression) of the target variable for that subset.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Pruning (Optional): \n",
    "Decision trees can be prone to overfitting, where they capture noise in the training data. Pruning involves removing branches from the tree that do not provide significant improvements in classification accuracy on a validation dataset. Pruning helps improve the tree's generalization performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Minimizing False Negatives is Crucial: In airport security, a false negative occurs when the screening system fails to detect a real threat or prohibited item (e.g., a weapon or explosive). The consequences of a false negative can be catastrophic, potentially leading to security breaches, endangering lives, and causing significant harm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Trade-offs with False Positives: While minimizing false negatives is crucial, the airport security context also involves false positives (e.g., innocent objects or harmless items triggering alarms). Although false positives are undesirable, they are generally less critical than missing a real threat. Security personnel can further inspect and resolve false positives, but they cannot afford to miss potential threats.\n",
    "\n",

    "Comprehensive Screening: Airport security aims to provide comprehensive screening to ensure that dangerous items or individuals with malicious intent are detected. Achieving a high recall means that the screening process is more likely to identify all potential threats, making the airport safer.\n",

    "In this scenario, recall is prioritized because it focuses on minimizing the chances of missing a real threat. A high-recall model ensures that security systems are highly effective in identifying potential risks, even if it results in a higher number of false alarms (false positives). The emphasis is on comprehensive and rigorous screening to prioritize security and safety in a critical environment like airport security.\n",
